**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on January 21, 2024**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** January 21, 2024, 09:30 AM - 12:45 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Users experienced a 30% increase in response times across our web application, resulting in intermittent service disruptions and degraded user experience.
- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by an unforeseen surge in traffic due to a sudden increase in bot activity combined with a misconfigured caching mechanism.

**Timeline:**
- **09:30 AM:** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in response times.
- **09:35 AM:** Initial investigation focused on server performance, suspecting increased user load. Assumed a possible DDoS attack due to the abrupt surge.
- **10:00 AM:** Engaged the security team to analyze network traffic and identify any malicious activity. No signs of a DDoS attack were found.
- **10:30 AM:** Expanded investigation to database servers, suspecting slow queries or database bottlenecks. No significant issues found.
- **11:00 AM:** Noticed a misconfiguration in the caching layer, leading to the serving of stale content to users.
- **11:15 AM:** Incorrectly assumed the caching misconfiguration was the root cause and attempted to clear the cache. The issue persisted.
- **11:45 AM:** Escalated the incident to the DevOps team to examine the web server configurations and identify any issues. No conclusive findings.
- **12:00 PM:** Engaged the development team to investigate the application code for potential bugs or inefficiencies.
- **12:30 PM:** Discovered the surge in traffic was caused by a sudden influx of bots repeatedly requesting the same content, overwhelming the caching layer.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The root cause was twofold - a misconfigured caching layer that failed to handle the sudden increase in bot activity, and the inability to differentiate legitimate user requests from bot requests.
- **Resolution:** Implemented a bot detection mechanism at the edge server to filter out malicious bot traffic. Adjusted caching configurations to better handle varying levels of traffic. Deployed a hotfix to the application code to improve the efficiency of content delivery.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
    - Enhance monitoring capabilities to quickly identify and differentiate bot traffic.
    - Implement stricter caching policies to prevent stale content delivery during traffic surges.
    - Enhance security protocols to identify and block malicious bots proactively.

- **Tasks:**
    - Deploy an updated version of the application with the implemented hotfix.
    - Conduct a thorough review of caching configurations to identify and rectify potential issues.
    - Collaborate with the security team to fine-tune bot detection mechanisms.
    - Update incident response protocols to streamline communication and escalation processes during outages.

This postmortem outlines the key details of the web stack outage, providing a clear understanding of the duration, impact, root cause, and the steps taken to resolve the issue. The corrective and preventative measures highlight specific tasks to address the identified issues and prevent similar incidents in the future.
